## Ahtapot BSGS

Ahtapot BSGS is a multi-layer integrated cyber security system.
Initiated as one of the support projects to promote the Pardus/Linux national operating system project, the Ahtapot Integrated Cyber Security Project has moved towards productization after completing its DevOps stages.

Ahtapot BSGS is 100% free. It is committed to ensuring that all components will be free in accordance with the guidelines. Support will be provided to users who develop and use non-free software. The system will never depend on any element related to non-free software.

The products generated by the Ahtapot BSGS team will be shared with the free software community. When we write a new component, it will be licensed in a way that is compatible with the Ahtapot BSGS Free Software guidelines.

Issues will not be concealed, and the entire error-reporting database will be kept open.

The priority of Ahtapot BSGS is the cyber security needs of public institutions and organizations, as well as free software. These priorities will guide the project. Support will be provided not only for Pardus/Linux but also for the needs arising from users' work in different computing environments.

Others will be allowed to create distributions containing Ahtapot BSGS components, and a high-quality integrated system without any legal restrictions hindering such uses will continue to be developed to support these goals.
